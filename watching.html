        My <a href="https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23107319/" target="_blank" tooltip="Opens in new a window">IMDb</a> 
        lists like rating and watch-list etc. 
        Here's my <a href="https://letterboxd.com/amarendra/" target="_blank" tooltip="Opens in new a window">Letterboxd</a> profile link.

        Other than Letterboxd I also keep uploading my IMDb ratings/data to 
        <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/u/amarendra" target="_blank" tooltip="Opens in new a window">TMDb</a> 
        just in case IMdB goes pretty much unusable.

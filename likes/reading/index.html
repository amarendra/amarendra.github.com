<h1>Reading</h1>

<p>I have a big <a href="./booklist/">list of books</a> I have read till now. Not really that big, but yes, it&#39;s big.
I usually read from my own collection I have built over the years where at any given time the amount of unread books are in double digits. 
I seldom get time these days to go out for books, so I just buy online(paper,  <a href="why-not-ebooks-link">I do not prefer eBooks</a>). 
I hope it will change and I will again start visiting to libraries and book stores.</p>

<p>I used to love to go book fairs and Patna is one good place for book lovers with its various book fairs and seminars throughout the year. 
Not to mention the rich literary heritage especially of Hindi literature. </p>

<p>My three year stint as library in-charge of my School&#39;s student council were my formative years of reading books and it has left a profound impact on my tastes 
and nuances when it comes to books. Those were my best years. For books and everything else. The years of innocence. The books I read there mostly in Hindi and 
that is where I was introduced to literature from various countries, both in Hindi and English (translations included). 
I remember reading <a href="http://www.librarything.com/work/10119042">The Cossacks </a> and then Tagore&#39;s <em>Gora</em> as Hindi translations. 
I think that where I had read Maxim Gorky&#39;s <em>Mother</em>, but I do not remember at all. Maybe I didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Then I went to Patna for my Engineering and the amount reading diminished(not necessarily because I had less time). At least my literature reading. 
The books, articles and magazines were replaced by those from course matter and related to Computer Science. I tried to keep up. [Ashok Rajpath]<br>
was my favourite with roadside stalls selling magazines and books at very affordable prices. Whatever I lost of reading literary books 
I tried compensate buying and reading lots magazine off those vendors <a href="hansmonthky.com">Hans</a>, Kathadesh, <a href="rd.com">Reader&#39;s Digest</a>, 
few old <a href="http://www.granta.com/">Granta</a> issues and then there were other magazines I forgot the names of. It was like whatever I could get my hands on 
I would buy and then try to finish them whenever I had some time which needless say were not in short supply. </p>

<p>Right after college I had to join corporate world. First Indore where I don&#39;t think I read anything in those 2-3 months and then Bangalore where I am settles 
for the last 3 years. I have been reading. Intermittently. Time is really the problem here, unlike college where it was mostly idling, change priorities, 
fun and frolic.</p>

<p>So here&#39;s a list of books I have read recently. These are not many but as explained above I have been reading less these days. Items marks with 
a star * are highly recommended:</p>

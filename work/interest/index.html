<h1>Research Interest</h1>

<h2>Rich Internet Applications</h2>

<p>I have also been drawn towards RIA. I had even done my summer internship in RIA and developed
a Twitter application using Adobe Flex.</p>

<p>Later during my work at Samsung Research India I have had various opportunities to work on Android apps
that are deeply integrated to the the Internet and social networks.</p>

<h2>Natural Language Processing</h2>

<p>One of my first projects at Samsung was developing an idea project. It was a system 
we(me and four other engineers) developed which would take speech commands and the command 
shall be processed into speech(using a Speech to Text library) and then the text shall be parsed in a fuzzy way
to interpret commands and work on various objects aspects of phone or PDA.</p>

<h2>Data Science</h2>

<p>During my college I took a data warehousing course and we were given an assignment where we had to estimate how
much data does hour city&#39;s various government utility systems process each month. Even though it was just
an assignment and we were to produce a reasonable estimate, it was astonishing to see the amount of data
flowing throw those systems and that city was a tier 3 cities in terms of population. I started to think about
how these data can be managed, stored and then accessed in a better way. </p>

<p>Later on I had many opportunities to explore similar subjects at work. I even took a MOOOC <a href="https://education.10gen.com/courses/10gen/M101J/2013_October/about">course</a> in Java and MongoDB.</p>

<h2>Image Manipulation</h2>

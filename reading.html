    <h2>Reading</h2>

    <p>
        I have a big <a href="books.html">list of books</a> I have read or I possess. I usually read from my own collection I have built over the years where at any given point in time the unread books are in double digits. I like going to the book stores to buy my books or pick one at the railway station, the airport. Once in a while I do visit libraries too. In fact for sometime book browsing on Church Street used to be a weekend ritual.

        I used to love to go book fairs when I was in Patna. The place has a rich literary heritage, especially in Hindi literature. There's a lit fest in Bangalore but I have not attended any book fairs yet. In fact I have not attended one after college.

        My three year stint as library in-charge of my school's student council were my formative years of reading. It has left a profound impression on my taste and nuances of reading I'd say. Those were best of my years. For books and everything else. The last few years of innocence. The books I read in school were mostly Hindi books. School is also where I was introduced to literature from other countries, both in Hindi and English.<br/><br/>
        
        I remember reading <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/10119042" target="_blank" tooltip="Opens in new a window">The Cossacks</a> and then Tagore's <em>Gora</em> as Hindi translations. I think that is where I had read Maxim Gorky's <em>Mother</em> as well, but I do not remember now. Maybe I didn't.

    <p>
        Then I went to Patna to study engineering and the amount of reading reduced, not necessarily because I had less time. Time I had but the priorities were misplaced or had just changed.<br/>
        
        I did try to keep up. Ashok Rajpath near dental college was a favourite locality with roadside stalls selling old (that would be a week old, or a month) magazines and books at very affordable prices. Whatever I lost in reading literary books I tried to overcompensate by buying and reading lots of magazines from those vendors. I remember one whom I used to call Raju bhaiya. <a href="http://hansmonthky.com" target="_blank" tooltip="Possibly a broken link; opens in new a window">Hans</a>, Kathadesh, Reader's Digest, few old Granta issues and then there were many other magazines like Outlook et cetera. I'd buy whatever I could get my hands on; as per the remaining pocket money at that time of month.

        After college I moved to Indore. I don't think I read anything there except A Jeffrey Archer on office computer. In Bangalore I have been reading again. Intermittently.

    <p>
        So here is a list of books I have read.<br/>
        Items marks with a star * come highly recommended.

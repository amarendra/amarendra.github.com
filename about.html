    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        I am from the village of <a href="https://wikimapia.org/street/1148983/Ijraha-Chhaurahi-Begusarai-Bihar-848202" target="_blank" tooltip="Opens in new a window">Ijraha</a>. It's in Begusarai (Bihar). In the eastern part of India (it's the East, not North; never). That's where I finished <a href="https://wikimapia.org//29225196/Primary-School" target="_blank" tooltip="Opens in new a window">primary school</a>.<br/><br/>
        
        For high school I moved to a boarding school called SSVM near Rosera <a href="https://wikimapia.org/12331503/ssvm-bataha-rosera" target="_blank" tooltip="Opens in new a window">where</a> I had best of my years. </p>

    <p>
        I did my senior secondary at <a href="http://chinmayabokaro.co.in/" target="_blank" tooltip="Possibly a broken link; opens in a new window">Chinmaya Vidyalaya Bokaro</a>.<br/><br/>
        
        Then I moved to Patna for undergraduate studies in the field of Computer Science.<br/>

    <p>
        After graduating I moved to Bangalore and worked at Samsung&#39;s India mobile R&amp;D division <a href="https://research.samsung.com/sri-b" target="_blank" tooltip="They keep changing company URL and then forget to redirect from old to new; opens in a window">SRI-B</a> for a few years. Then at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ola_Cabs" target="_blank" tooltip="Opens in new a window">Ola Cabs</a>. Currently (as of Jan 2024) I am working at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socure" target="_blank" tooltip="Opens in new a window">Socure</a>. Domain wise, over the years, it's been all over (it's kinda fun, building things in a new domain) but tech has been Android and mobile pretty much throughout.

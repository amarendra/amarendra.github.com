    <h2>Interests</h2>

    <h3>Rich Internet Applications</h3>

    <p>
        During a summer internship I developed<br/>
        a Twitter application using Adobe Flex.<br/>
        Later I worked on couple of social Android apps.</p>

    <h3>NLP</h3>

    <p>
        One of my first projects at work<br/>
        was a system which would take speech commands<br/>
        and the commands were processed into text<br/>
        and then the text shall be parsed<br/>
        to interpret commands.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Science</h3>

    <p>
        This is a field that I have been interested in<br/>
        but never got around to actually work in it,<br/>
        other than some courses and couple of examples<br/>
        on Kaggle. I must change that soon.

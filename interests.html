    <h2>Interests</h2>

    <h3>Rich Internet Applications</h3>

    <p>
        During a summer internship I developed a Twitter application using Adobe Flex. Later I worked on couple of social Android apps.
    </p>

    <h3>NLP</h3>

    <p>
        One of my first projects at work was a system which would take speech commands and the commands were processed into text and then the text shall be parsed to interpret commands.
    </p>

    <h3>ML</h3>

    <p>
        This is a field that I have been interested in but never got around to actually work in it, other than some courses and couple of examples on Kaggle.

    <h3>Apps</h3>
    <p>
        And yes, developing simple, not bloated (minimal), blazing fast native apps (have done that in Android so far) is a passion. I prefer to use as few libraries as I can. Unless a library or a plugin gives me considerable benefit for some use-case that's either huge or repeated I would rather use the vanilla constructs provided by the platform/OS. Of all the principles my favourite is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" target="_blank" tooltip="Opens in new window">KISS</a>.

    <h2>Interests</h2>

    <h3>Rich Internet Applications</h3>

    <p>During my summer internship I developed a Twitter application using Adobe Flex. Later I worked on couple of Android apps deeply integrated with the the Internet and social networks.</p>

    <h3>NLP</h3>

    <p>One of my first projects at work was a system which would take speech commands and the commands were processed into speech(using a Speech to Text library) and then the text shall be parsed in a fuzzy manner to interpret commands and act accordingly on various objects/aspects of the device.</p>

    <h3>Data Science</h3>

    <p>During a data warehousing course we were given an assignment where we had to estimate how much data that city's various government utility systems process each month. It was astonishing to see the amount of data flowing throw those systems and that city was a tier 3 cities in terms of population. This prompted me to think about how this data can be managed, stored and then accessed in a better way. More importantly, that experience helped me shape my interests on how such large amount of data can be used to take get meaning out of them, how they can be cleaned, and represented in a different, and better way.</p>

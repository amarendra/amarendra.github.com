    <h2>Interests</h2>

    <h3>Rich Internet Applications</h3>

    <p>
        During a summer internship I developed a Twitter application using Adobe Flex. Later I worked on couple of social Android apps.
    </p>

    <h3>NLP</h3>

    <p>
        One of my first projects at work was a system which would take speech commands and the commands were processed into text and then the text shall be parsed to interpret commands.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Science</h3>

    <p>
        This is a field that I have been interested in but never got around to actually work in it, other than some courses and couple of examples on Kaggle. I must change that soon.

http://amar.im - My website
===========================

This repository is keeps my website's content and the design/theme is a form of Mark Reid's original Jekyll site's design and content at <http://mark.reid.name> up until early 2013.

I've tried my best to remove anything which is even remotely his personal data and if you want to fork this repo or his you should do the same. Read [here](https://github.com/mreid/mark.reid.name#important) for instructions.
